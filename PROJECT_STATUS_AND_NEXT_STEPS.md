## 2. NEXT STEPS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### **Step 1: Document Creation** ✅ (Current Task)
Create comprehensive status document outlining current achievements and next phase objectives.

### **Step 2: Git Repository Update** 📋 (Next)
- Commit all recent validation results and analysis files
- Update project documentation with latest performance metrics
- Tag current state as "v1.0-production-ready"
- Push comprehensive analysis summaries to repository

### **Step 3: Air Quality Index Integration** 🎯 (Primary Objective)

#### **3.1 Air Quality Index (AQI) Implementation**

**Objective**: Extend forecasting capability to predict composite Air Quality Index values, enabling categorical air quality warnings for public health protection.

**Technical Approach**:
- **Standard AQI Calculation**: Implement EPA/WHO standard AQI computation
- **Multi-Pollutant Integration**: Combine PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3 into single index
- **Categorical Classification**: Low, Moderate, Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups, Unhealthy, Very Unhealthy
- **Health-Based Thresholds**: Focus on protecting sensitive populations

#### **3.2 AQI Calculation Method**
```
AQI = ((I_hi - I_lo) / (C_hi - C_lo)) * (C - C_lo) + I_lo

Where:
- C = Pollutant concentration
- C_lo = Concentration breakpoint ≤ C
- C_hi = Concentration breakpoint ≥ C
- I_lo = AQI value corresponding to C_lo
- I_hi = AQI value corresponding to C_hi
```

**Standard AQI Breakpoints**:
- **0-50**: Good (Green)
- **51-100**: Moderate (Yellow)
- **101-150**: Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (Orange) ⚠️
- **151-200**: Unhealthy (Red) ⚠️
- **201-300**: Very Unhealthy (Purple) 🚨
- **301-500**: Hazardous (Maroon) 🚨

#### **3.3 Health Warning Integration**

**Critical Public Health Metrics**:
- **Sensitive Population Warnings**: AQI ≥ 101 (Orange level)
  - Elderly, children, people with heart/lung conditions
  - Recommendation: Limit prolonged outdoor exertion
- **General Population Warnings**: AQI ≥ 151 (Red level)
  - Recommendation: Avoid outdoor exercise, reduce outdoor activities

**Performance Evaluation Framework**:
- **Classification Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-Score for categorical predictions
- **Health-Focused Metrics**:
  - **Sensitivity for High AQI**: Minimize false negatives (missing unhealthy days)
  - **Specificity Balance**: Avoid excessive false alarms
  - **Warning Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly predicted warning days

#### **3.4 Model Optimization for AQI**

**Ensemble Adaptation**:
- **Ridge Ensemble Enhancement**: Optimize for categorical prediction
- **Threshold Calibration**: Adjust decision boundaries for health warnings
- **Cost-Sensitive Learning**: Penalize false negatives more heavily than false positives
- **Multi-Output Prediction**: Predict both continuous concentrations and AQI categories

**Evaluation Metrics for AQI Forecasting**:
- **Continuous Metrics**: MAE, RMSE for AQI values
- **Categorical Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall for each AQI category
  - Confusion matrices for misclassification analysis
  - Cohen's Kappa for agreement beyond chance
- **Health-Impact Metrics**:
  - True Positive Rate for "Unhealthy" predictions (sensitivity)
  - False Negative Rate for warning levels (critical to minimize)
  - Days correctly warned vs. days missed

#### **3.5 Expected Deliverables**

**Code Deliverables**:
- `calculate_aqi.py`: Standard AQI computation from pollutant concentrations
- `aqi_ensemble_forecasting.py`: Extended ensemble models for AQI prediction
