# Project Goal

There is scientific literature showing that global weather forecasts can be improved by adding local information.
Notable examples include:

## Objective

Test whether adding local information similarly improves air pollutant forecasts. We will build a simple, transparent implementation that combines global forecast data with local features and evaluate whether this improves forecast accuracy.

---

## Benchmarks

- ECMWF-CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service)
- NOAA-GEFS-Aerosol (Global Ensemble Forecast System – Aerosols)

---

## Model

Use a Gradient Boosting model (e.g., XGBoost) that ingests:
- Forecast data from CAMS and/or NOAA-GEFS-Aerosol
- Local features (calendar variables, lagged observations, lagged forecasts)

---

## Evaluation Strategy

1) Backtesting with historical data (last two years)
   - Train on year 1
   - Walk-forward on year 2 (train up to day t, predict t+1)

2) Live forecasting and monitoring
   - Publish daily forecasts on a public website
   - Periodically compare against benchmarks

---

## Experimental Setups

a) CAMS + local features → compared against raw CAMS
b) NOAA-GEFS-Aerosol + local features → compared against raw NOAA
c) CAMS + NOAA-GEFS-Aerosol + local features → compared against both

This setup measures whether simple ML downscaling with local features can systematically outperform global forecasts for air pollutants.
