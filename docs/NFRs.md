# Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) – Global Air Quality Forecasting System

## Performance & Accuracy
- **Global Scale**: Forecasts ready within 5 minutes for all 100 cities simultaneously
- **Health Warnings**: Critical health alerts generated within 2 minutes of data availability
- **Accuracy Target**: >90% health warning recall, >10% MAE improvement vs. regional benchmarks
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time data collection and processing for all continental sources

## Reliability
- **System Uptime**: ≥99% availability across all 5 continental data collection systems
- **Data Quality**: ≥95% successful data collection from public APIs per month
- **Failover**: Automated fallback to satellite/backup data sources
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

## Scalability
- **Current Capacity**: 100 cities across 5 continents with 11 AQI standards
- **Expansion Ready**: Architecture supports scaling to 500+ cities without redesign
- **Continental Balance**: Equal performance across Europe, North America, Asia, Africa, South America
- **Multi-Standard**: Support for additional regional AQI standards as needed

## Transparency
- **Public Data Only**: Zero dependency on personal API keys or proprietary data
- **Open Methodology**: Complete documentation of all 11 AQI calculation methods
- **Benchmark Comparison**: Public validation against regional standard forecasting systems
- **Health Focus**: Clear documentation of health warning thresholds and sensitivity analysis

## Security & Compliance
- **No Authentication**: System operates entirely on public APIs and open data
- **Data Privacy**: No personal data collection across any continental system
- **API Compliance**: Respectful usage of all public APIs within terms of service
- **Attribution**: Proper credit for all government and research data sources

## Cost Efficiency
- **Current Stage**: Zero API costs (public sources only)
- **Production Target**: <€50/month for full 100-city global deployment
- **Scalability**: Cost-linear scaling for additional cities and regions
- **Resource Optimization**: Distributed processing and intelligent caching
