# Global Air Quality Forecasting System - Data Collection Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the **Option 5: Hybrid Data Source Strategy** for implementing data collection across all 100 cities in the Global Air Quality Forecasting System. This approach combines the efficiency of source-based collection with the risk management of incremental city sampling.

**Strategy**: Start with 1 data source across 5 representative cities (1 per continent), prove the pattern works, then scale continent-wide using the validated approach.

## 🎯 Strategic Approach: Option 5 - "Data Source with City Sampling"

### Core Principle
**"Start Narrow, Think Systematically"** - Prove each continental data source works with a small sample, then scale the proven pattern across all cities in that continent.

### Implementation Philosophy
- **Risk Mitigation**: Test with 5 cities before committing to 100 cities
- **Pattern Validation**: Establish working data collection patterns before scaling
- **Context Management**: Keep complexity manageable within session token limits
- **Global Coverage**: Ensure all 5 continents represented from day 1
- **Systematic Scaling**: Once proven, scale efficiently continent-wide

## 📋 Phase 1: Proof of Concept (5 Representative Cities)

### Selected Representative Cities

| Continent | City | Country | AQI Standard | Data Source | Complexity Level |
|-----------|------|---------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Europe** | Berlin | Germany | European EAQI | EEA | ⭐⭐ Easy |
| **North America** | Toronto | Canada | Canadian AQHI | Environment Canada | ⭐⭐ Easy |
| **Asia** | Delhi | India | Indian National AQI | CPCB Portal | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Complex |
| **Africa** | Cairo | Egypt | WHO Guidelines | WHO Data | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium |
| **South America** | São Paulo | Brazil | EPA AQI | Brazilian Government | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium |

### Selection Rationale
- **Berlin**: Excellent EEA data availability, well-documented APIs
- **Toronto**: Strong Environment Canada infrastructure, good documentation
- **Delhi**: Highest global pollution levels, most important for health impact
- **Cairo**: Largest African city with available data, WHO data testing
