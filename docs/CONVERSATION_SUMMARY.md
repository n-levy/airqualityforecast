# Global Air Quality Forecasting System - Conversation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the development conversation for the Global Air Quality Forecasting System, covering the evolution from a 3-German-city system to a 100-city global implementation.

## 🗂️ Session Context and Evolution

### Previous Conversation Foundation
The system originated as a PM2.5 forecasting project focused on 3 German cities (Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt) using personal API keys from OpenAQ and CAMS. The conversation evolved to address scalability, global health impact, and public data accessibility.

### Current Session Key Developments
1. **API Strategy Clarification**: Confirmed shift from personal API keys to public-only data sources
2. **Delhi Implementation Removal**: Eliminated city-specific implementations in favor of global framework
3. **Documentation Standardization**: Comprehensive update of all project documentation
4. **Evaluation Framework Creation**: Detailed methodology for model assessment
5. **Global Cities Configuration**: Complete 100-city mapping across 5 continents
6. **Data Collection Strategy**: Hybrid approach to avoid system overload during implementation

- **Geographic Coverage**: 100 cities across 5 continents (20 cities per continent)
- **AQI Standards**: 11 regional calculation methods (EPA, EAQI, Indian, Chinese, etc.)
- **Data Sources**: Public APIs only, no personal API keys required
- **Forecasting Models**: Simple Average + Ridge Regression (Phase 4), Gradient Boosting (Phase 5)
- **Health Focus**: Sensitive groups and general population warning systems

### Success Criteria

#### 3. Ensemble Models
```
Phase 4 Implementation:
├── Simple Average Ensemble
