# ROADMAP

## Stage 0 – Scaffold
Purpose: Set up reproducible, documented, automation-ready foundation.

## Stage 1 – Multi-City PM₂.₅ (Berlin, Munich, Hamburg) with CAMS, Aurora, and NOAA GEFS-Aerosol integration
Cities: Berlin, Munich, Hamburg
Providers: CAMS, Aurora, NOAA GEFS-Aerosol
Features: Calendar features, lag features (see FEATURES.md)
Bias Correction: Applied to all cities in model
Outputs: Forecasts, verification, dashboard

## Stage 2 – Expansion & Cloud Migration
Add cities; migrate to cloud (scheduled containers, object storage); target <€10/month.

## Stage 3 – Per-Pollutant AQI
Extend to PM₁₀, O₃, NO₂; compute AQI; track dominant pollutant.
