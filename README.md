# Air Quality Forecasting Pipeline

A comprehensive air quality forecasting system that combines multiple forecast models using advanced ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 concentrations.

## Project Status

### Current Implementation
- **Production-ready ensemble forecasting pipeline**
- **5+ years of comprehensive synthetic data** (2020-01-01 to 2025-09-08)
- **Multiple validation approaches** including walk-forward validation
- **Significant performance improvements** over individual forecast models

### Dataset Overview
- **Temporal Coverage**: 5+ years (2020-2025)
- **Temporal Resolution**: Hourly data (149,547 records)
- **Spatial Coverage**: 3 German cities (Berlin, Hamburg, Munich)
- **Features**: 82 comprehensive features including:
  - Meteorological variables (temperature, humidity, wind, pressure)
  - Temporal features (seasonal patterns, holidays, time-of-day)
  - Air quality forecasts from CAMS and NOAA GEFS-Aerosol
  - Engineered features (spatial gradients, model spreads, interactions)
  - External factors (fire activity, construction, economic indicators)

### Data Sources
- **CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service)**: European air quality forecasts
- **NOAA GEFS-Aerosol**: Global ensemble aerosol forecasts
- **Synthetic realistic data**: Weather, traffic, and external factors based on real-world patterns
- **Real external data integration**: NASA FIRMS, OpenStreetMap, USGS, weather APIs

## Validation Approach

### Walk-Forward Validation (Recommended)
Our primary validation approach uses **walk-forward validation with all features**, which most closely simulates real deployment conditions:

**Methodology:**
- **Training**: Use all historical data up to current prediction point
- **Testing**: Predict next time period using all available features (including seasonal)
- **Progressive**: Continuously update training set with new observations
- **Realistic**: Mirrors exactly how the system will operate in production

**Why This Approach:**
- ✅ **Operationally Realistic**: Models will have seasonal features available in deployment
- ✅ **No Artificial Constraints**: Uses full feature set as intended for production
- ✅ **Progressive Learning**: Tests model adaptation to changing patterns
- ✅ **Temporal Integrity**: Respects time-series structure without data leakage

**Validation Period**: Past year of data (2024-09-09 to 2025-09-08)

### Alternative Validation Methods Explored
- **Blocked Time Series**: Good for testing long-term stability
- **Seasonal Split**: Invalid due to data leakage with temporal features
- **Geographic Cross-Validation**: Tests spatial generalization (challenging)

## Model Performance

### Ensemble Methods
1. **Simple Average**: Basic mean of CAMS and NOAA forecasts
2. **Ridge Ensemble**: L2-regularized linear combination
3. **Random Forest**: Tree-based ensemble method
4. **Gradient Boosting**: Advanced gradient-based ensemble

### Benchmark Models
- **CAMS**: Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service forecasts
- **NOAA GEFS-Aerosol**: NOAA Global Ensemble Forecast System
