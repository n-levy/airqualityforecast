- **Real external data integration**: NASA FIRMS, OpenStreetMap, USGS, weather APIs

## Validation Approach

### Walk-Forward Validation (Recommended)
Our primary validation approach uses **walk-forward validation with all features**, which most closely simulates real deployment conditions:

**Methodology:**
- **Training**: Use all historical data up to current prediction point
- **Testing**: Predict next time period using all available features (including seasonal)
- **Progressive**: Continuously update training set with new observations
- **Realistic**: Mirrors exactly how the system will operate in production

**Why This Approach:**
- ✅ **Operationally Realistic**: Models will have seasonal features available in deployment
- ✅ **No Artificial Constraints**: Uses full feature set as intended for production
- ✅ **Progressive Learning**: Tests model adaptation to changing patterns
- ✅ **Temporal Integrity**: Respects time-series structure without data leakage

**Validation Period**: Past year of data (2024-09-09 to 2025-09-08)

### Alternative Validation Methods Explored
- **Blocked Time Series**: Good for testing long-term stability
- **Seasonal Split**: Invalid due to data leakage with temporal features
- **Geographic Cross-Validation**: Tests spatial generalization (challenging)

## Model Performance

### Ensemble Methods
1. **Simple Average**: Basic mean of CAMS and NOAA forecasts
2. **Ridge Ensemble**: L2-regularized linear combination
3. **Random Forest**: Tree-based ensemble method
4. **Gradient Boosting**: Advanced gradient-based ensemble

### Benchmark Models
- **CAMS**: Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service forecasts
- **NOAA GEFS-Aerosol**: NOAA Global Ensemble Forecast System

## Technical Architecture

### Data Processing Pipeline
